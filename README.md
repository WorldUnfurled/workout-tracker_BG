## Description
A fitness application that lets users create and track daily workouts.

## Installing

The npm packages used for this are as follows:

* *Express*: for the server
* *Mongoose*: for the mongoDB schema and connection
* *Morgan*: logger middleware

Use `npm i` to install all of them at once.

## Usage

Upon entering the site, you as a user will have an option to create a new workout. Accepting that option, you can select the type of workout and other specifications. You can then save the workout with the "Add Workout" button. If you'd like to update a workout, you will now have the option to add another exercise on the home screen. On the homescreen, you can view the aggregate stats of the exercises in the workout you have performed. You can also see detailed graphical over-time stats on the Dashboard page.

## Testing

console.log() is back at it once again with the utility. Robo3T was also instrumental in observing changes to my database.
